# Air Standard Cycle Simulator using Python

## Aim
The aim of this project is to create a simulator in Python to visualize the Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram and calculate the efficiency of the Otto Cycle, a fundamental thermodynamic cycle used in spark-ignition internal combustion engines.

## Objectives
The main objective of this project is to calculate all unknowns of each state using governing equations and given values. Subsequently, the project aims to plot the P-V diagram and calculate the efficiency of the cycle.

## Overview
The Otto Cycle is a gas power cycle utilized in modern petrol engines, consisting of four processes: two isentropic (reversible adiabatic) processes and two isochoric (constant volume) processes. By understanding these processes and their corresponding P-V and Temperature-Entropy (T-s) diagrams, this simulator provides insights into engine performance.

## Features
- Calculation of state variables for each phase of the Otto Cycle
- Visualization of the P-V diagram
- Efficiency calculation of the cycle

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/air-standard-cycle-simulator.git


## Usage
1. Open the `main.py` file in a Python environment.
2. Modify the parameters such as bore, stroke, compression ratio, etc., as needed.
3. Run the script to execute the simulation.
4. The program will output the efficiency of the Otto cycle and display the P-V diagram.
